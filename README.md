# Ribbon
APIs made easy

# CURRENTLY UNSTABLE
Ribbon is in a very early state and is under active development. Things might break or generally not work as intended. Use at your own risk.

# What?
Ribbon is a dependencyless, lightweight JavaScript API framework (though you can use it for anything, I won't judge) that prioritises ease of use and simplicity, while also being powerful when you need it.

# Why?
To make your life easier!

# How?
Ribbon tries to achieve its goals by having painfully simple syntax with no arbitrary limitations or bloat, allowing you to develop anything from a 5-minute prototype to a full backend.

# Example
Head over to `./example-server.js` to see an example of Ribbon in action.
